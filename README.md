This is Camille's GitHub Repository for power and sample size calculations for case/control genetic association studies.

The package allows for power and sample size calcualtions under model mis-specification.  

Power and/or sample size can be calculted for the following logisitic regression models:
	Additive Genetic Effect
	Dominant Genetic Effect
	Recessive Genetic Effect
	Unspecified Genetic Effect (2 degree of freedom test - most flexible)

The following true underlying genetic models can be assumed:
	Additive
	Dominant
	Recessive

Currently, covariates and gene x environment interactions cannot be included in the models. 

This package will be extended to continuous outcomes.
