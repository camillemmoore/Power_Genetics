Description: genpwr performs power and sample size calcualtions     
    for case/control genetic association studies and allows for   
    model mis-specification.  Power and/or sample size can be 
    calculted for the following logisitic regression models: 
    Additive Genetic Effect, Dominant Genetic Effect, Recessive 
    Genetic Effect, Unspecified Genetic Effect (2 degree of 
    freedom test - most flexible).  The following true underlying 
    genetic models can be assumed: Additive, Dominant, Recessive. 
    Currently, covariates and gene x environment interactions 
    cannot be included in the models. This package will be 
    extended to continuous outcomes.  
Depends: R (>= 3.3.2),
