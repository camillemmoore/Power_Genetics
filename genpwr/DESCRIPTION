Title: Power Calculations Under Genetic Model Misspecification
Version: 1.0.0
Authors@R: person("Camille", "Moore", email = 	"moorec@njhealth.org", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Performing power and sample size calculations     
    for case/control genetic association studies and allowing for   
    model misspecification.  Power and/or sample size can be 
    calculated for the following logistic regression models: 
    Additive Genetic Effect, Dominant Genetic Effect, Recessive 
    Genetic Effect, Unspecified Genetic Effect (2 degree of 
    freedom test - most flexible).
    Currently, covariates cannot be included in the models.
